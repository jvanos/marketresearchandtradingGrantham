## Jul 24 — EOD Snapshot (Day 15, Friday)
**Portfolio:** $49,578.40 | **Cash:** $12,521.42 (25.3%) | **Day P&L:** +$4.58 (+0.01%) | **Phase P&L:** -$421.60 (-0.84%)

| Ticker | Shares | Entry | Close | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L | Stop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DBC | 220 | $27.07 | $30.09 | -0.73% | +$664.40 (+11.16%) | $27.51 (10% trail) |
| GDX | 82 | $76.97 | $75.50 | +0.64% | -$120.47 (-1.91%) | $70.19 (10% trail) |
| GLDM | 90 | $82.65 | $80.19 | +0.10% | -$221.56 (-2.98%) | $74.42 (10% trail) |
| IEFA | 56 | $97.18 | $96.33 | +0.60% | -$47.60 (-0.88%) | $87.92 (10% trail) |
| SCHP | 240 | $26.19 | $26.08 | +0.04% | -$26.40 (-0.42%) | $23.57 (10% trail) |
| VWO | 93 | $59.06 | $57.80 | -0.52% | -$117.18 (-2.13%) | $53.68 (10% trail) |

**Notes:** Flat day (+$4.58), no new trades. Six positions carried, all GTC 10% trailing stops in place. DBC is the standout winner (+11.2% unrealized); GDX, GLDM, IEFA, SCHP, VWO are modestly underwater but within normal range, none near their stops. **Data-integrity flag:** this file was last updated Jul 3 (Day 0 baseline) — the mandatory EOD commit/push evidently did not run for 21 days despite live trading (fills on Jul 7, 13, 14, 22 per Alpaca order history: DBC/GLDM/EWY opened Jul 7, EWY round-tripped Jul 13, IEFA/VWO added Jul 14, GDX/SCHP added Jul 22). This snapshot was reconstructed directly from live Alpaca account/positions/orders data. The day-by-day entry/thesis history for Jul 6–23 is not recoverable from this log and needs manual backfill or reconciliation; investigate why prior sessions' Step 6 commits were not landing.

## Jul 28 — EOD Snapshot (Day 17, Tuesday)
**Portfolio:** $49,116.41 | **Cash:** $12,521.42 (25.5%) | **Day P&L:** -$461.99 (-0.93%) | **Phase P&L:** -$883.59 (-1.77%)

| Ticker | Shares | Entry | Close | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L | Stop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DBC | 220 | $27.07 | $28.60 | -1.41% | +$336.60 (+5.65%) | $27.51 (10% trail) |
| GDX | 82 | $76.97 | $74.21 | -2.01% | -$226.25 (-3.59%) | $70.19 (10% trail) |
| GLDM | 90 | $82.65 | $79.61 | -1.44% | -$273.43 (-3.68%) | $74.42 (10% trail) |
| IEFA | 56 | $97.18 | $96.72 | -0.11% | -$25.76 (-0.47%) | $87.92 (10% trail) |
| SCHP | 240 | $26.19 | $26.11 | +0.23% | -$19.20 (-0.31%) | $23.57 (10% trail) |
| VWO | 93 | $59.06 | $57.74 | -0.84% | -$122.76 (-2.24%) | $53.68 (10% trail) |

**Notes:** Broad pullback across the book (-$462, -0.93%), no new trades — still six positions, all unchanged since Jul 24, all GTC 10% trailing stops intact and none near triggering. DBC gave back some of its gain but remains the only winner (+5.65%); GDX and GLDM are the day's biggest laggards (-2% to -3.7% unrealized) but well clear of stops. **Data-integrity note:** no Jul 27 (Monday) EOD entry exists in this log — Alpaca's `last_equity` field (49,473.55) implies a trading day occurred between the Jul 24 and Jul 28 snapshots with no commit landing, echoing the earlier 21-day gap. Day P&L above is computed against the Jul 24 snapshot per protocol (comparison window one day wider); Alpaca-native Day P&L (vs. last_equity) would be -$357.14 (-0.72%). Recommend checking why the Jul 27 run didn't push.

## Jul 31 — EOD Snapshot (Day 20, Friday)
**Portfolio:** $49,510.53 | **Cash:** $12,521.42 (25.3%) | **Day P&L:** +$394.12 (+0.80%) | **Phase P&L:** -$489.47 (-0.98%)

| Ticker | Shares | Entry | Close | Day Chg | Unrealized P&L | Stop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DBC | 220 | $27.07 | $29.45 | +0.44% | +$523.60 (+8.79%) | $27.51 (10% trail) |
| GDX | 82 | $76.97 | $73.88 | -3.78% | -$253.31 (-4.01%) | $70.19 (10% trail) |
| GLDM | 90 | $82.65 | $80.14 | -1.46% | -$226.06 (-3.04%) | $74.42 (10% trail) |
| IEFA | 56 | $97.18 | $98.25 | -0.64% | +$59.92 (+1.10%) | $89.03 (10% trail, raised) |
| SCHP | 240 | $26.19 | $26.14 | +0.08% | -$12.00 (-0.19%) | $23.58 (10% trail) |
| VWO | 93 | $59.06 | $58.75 | +0.96% | -$28.83 (-0.53%) | $53.68 (10% trail) |

**Notes:** No new trades, still six positions all unchanged since Jul 22. GDX led the book lower (-3.78% day) on a metals pullback; DBC remains the standout winner (+8.79% unrealized) and IEFA's trailing stop has climbed to $89.03 as it makes new highs. None of the six stops are close to triggering. **Data-integrity note:** no Jul 29 (Wed) or Jul 30 (Thu) EOD entries exist in this log — the most recent prior snapshot is Jul 28, so Day P&L above is computed against a 3-day-old baseline (comparison window wider than usual, self-corrects going forward). Alpaca-native Day P&L (today's equity vs. `last_equity` $49,805.23) is -$294.70 (-0.59%). Recommend checking why the Jul 29/30 runs didn't push.
